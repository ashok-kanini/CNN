    ## Predicting Dog breed classifier.

`There are 133 classes of dogs and when a dog image is given as input the model should predict what
is dog breed`

Initially I train the model using VGG16 classifier (i.e.) pretrained models, later created a CNN model. The convoluted image will has dimensions of 7*7*120.
The model was training well enough of applied Transfer learning to improve the accuracy of my model, for which I applied VGG16 again and trained the model using 50 epoch.
